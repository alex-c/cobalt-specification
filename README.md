This is the language specification for the Cobalt programming language. Read it [here](https://alex-c.github.io/cobalt-specification)!

### About Cobalt
Cobalt is a statically and strongly typed programming language, that uses type inference.

### Disclaimer
Cobalt is a programming language I created purely for learning purposes. I do not claim that it is good or useful in any respect, nor that it solves any problems, that other languages don't. Cobalt is an experiment, with the main goal of writing a compiler for it.
